JUSTICE (JUST Integrated Climate Economy) is an open-source Integrated Assessment Modelling Framework allowing exploration of modelling assumptions on Climate Policies. JUSTICE is a simulation-optimization model that enables multiobjective optimization using Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) and Multiagent Multiobjective Reinforcement Learning (MOMARL).

JUSTICE is designed to explore the influence on distributive justice outcomes due to underlying modelling assumptions across model components and functions: the economy and climate components, emissions, abatement, damage and social welfare functions. JUSTICE is a simple IAM inspired by the long-established RICE, and RICE50+, and is designed to be a surrogate for more complex IAMs for eliciting normative insights.
