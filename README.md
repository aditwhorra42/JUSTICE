JUSTICE (JUST Integrated Climate Economy) is an open-source Integrated Assessment Modelling Framework for Normative Uncertainty Analysis

JUSTICE is designed to explore the influence on distributive justice outcomes due to underlying modelling assumptions across model components and functions: the economy and climate components, emissions, abatement, damage and social welfare functions. JUSTICE is a simple IAM inspired by the long-established RICE, and RICE50+, and is designed to be a surrogate for more complex IAMs for eliciting normative insights.
